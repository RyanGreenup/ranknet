* Introduction
  Ranknet is an approach to /Machine-Learned Ranking/ developed by
  Microsoft as early as 2004
  cite:christopherburgesRankNetRankingRetrospective2015, although
  previous work in this area had already been undertaken as early as
  the 90s (see
  generally
  cite:fuhrProbabilisticModelsInformation1992,fuhrOptimumPolynomialRetrieval1989,fuhrProbabilisticModelsInformation1992,geyInferringProbabilityRelevance1994,wongLinearStructureInformation1988)
  these earlier models didn't perform well compared to more modern machine
  learning techniques [[cite:manningIntroductionInformationRetrieval2008][\S 15.5]].

  /Machine-Learned
  Ranking/ is the process of applying machine learning algorithms to
  ranking problems, it often refered to as /Learning to Rank// cite:liuLearningRankInformation2009.
* Motivation
  Much data cannot clearly categorised or quantified even if it there
  is a capacity to compare different samples, the motivating example
  is a collection of documents, it might be immediately clear to the reader which
  documents are more relevant than others, even if the reader would
  not be able to quantify a "relevance score" for each document.

  By training a model to identify a more relevant document, a ranking
  can be applied to the data.

  An example of this might be identifying documents in a companies
  interwiki that are relevant for new employees, by training the model
  to rank whether one document is more relevant than an other,
  ultimately an ordered list of documents most relevant for new
  employees could be created.
* Implementation
  To implement the RankNet approach, a neural network will be trained
  to identify a score.

  Then a sigmoid function to identify a similarity score.

  First apply to an obvious data set.

  Then use a different optimiser
  Then allow it to use more data
  then a different data set
  Then a non-obvious data set, like wine
  Finally Documents.

* Conclusion

* Further Research

  - Apply this to documents to get a sorted list.
  - The "Quicksort" algorithm likely needs a random pivot to be efficient cite:timroughgardenQuicksortOverview2017

* Text and References
Fractals are complex shapes that often occur from natural processes, in this
report we hope to investigate the emergence of patterns and complex structures
from natural phenomena. We begin with an investigation into fractals and the
concept of dimension and then discuss links between fractal patterns and natural
processes.
