  abstract = {Fine-grained epidemiological modeling of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 -- capturing who is infected at which locations -- can aid the development of policy responses that account for heterogeneous risks of different locations as well as the disparities in infections among different demographic groups. Here, we develop a metapopulation SEIR disease model that uses dynamic mobility networks, derived from US cell phone data, to capture the hourly movements of millions of people from local neighborhoods (census block groups, or CBGs) to points of interest (POIs) such as restaurants, grocery stores, or religious establishments. We simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from March 1 - May 2, 2020 among a population of 98 million people in 10 of the largest US metropolitan statistical areas. We show that by integrating these mobility networks, which connect 57k CBGs to 553k POIs with a total of 5.4 billion hourly edges, even a relatively simple epidemiological model can accurately capture the case trajectory despite dramatic changes in population behavior due to the virus. Furthermore, by modeling detailed information about each POI, like visitor density and visit length, we can estimate the impacts of fine-grained reopening plans: we predict that a small minority of "superspreader" POIs account for a large majority of infections, that reopening some POI categories (like full-service restaurants) poses especially large risks, and that strategies restricting maximum occupancy at each POI are more effective than uniformly reducing mobility. Our models also predict higher infection rates among disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups solely from differences in mobility: disadvantaged groups have not been able to reduce mobility as sharply, and the POIs they visit (even within the same category) tend to be smaller, more crowded, and therefore more dangerous. By modeling who is infected at which locations, our model supports fine-grained analyses that can inform more effective and equitable policy responses to SARS-CoV-2.},

Previously explored methods for computing such a ranking have involved the use of statistical independence assumptions and multiple regression analysis on a learning sample. In this paper these techniques are recombined in a new way to achieve greater accuracy of probabilistic estimate without undue additional computational complexity. The novel element of the proposed design is that the regression analysis be carried out in two or more levels or stages. Such an approach allows composite or grouped retrieval clues to be analyzed in an orderly manner -- first within groups, and then between. It compensates automatically for systematic biases introduced by the statistical simplifying assumptions, and gives rise to search algorithms of reasonable computational efficiency.},

Then we describe an approach for the development of optimum polynomial retrieval functions: request-document pairs (fl, dm) are mapped onto description vectors x(fl, dm), and a polynomial function e(x) is developed such that it yields estimates of the probability of relevance P(R | x (fl, dm) with minimum square errors. We give experimental results for the application of this approach to documents with weighted indexing as well as to documents with complex representations. In contrast to other probabilistic models, our approach yields estimates of the actual probabilities, it can handle very complex representations of documents and requests, and it can be easily applied to multivalued relevance scales. On the other hand, this approach is not suited to log-linear probabilistic models and it needs large samples of relevance feedback data for its application.},

First, the basic concepts of this approach are described: the probability-ranking principle shows that optimum retrieval quality can be achieved under certain assumptions; a conceptual model for IR along with the corresponding event space clarify the interpretation of the probabilistic parameters involved. For the estimation of these parameters, three different learning strategies are distinguished, namely query-related, document-related and description-related learning. As a representative for each of these strategies, a specific model is described. A new approach regards IR as uncertain inference; here, imaging is used as a new technique for estimating the probabilistic parameters, and probabilistic inference networks support more complex forms of inference. Finally, the more general problems of parameter estimations, query expansion and the development of models for advanced document representations are discussed.},

Traditional scientific publishing, that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50~years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for SCI up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that SCI was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by SCI is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that SCI has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in SSCI was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by SSCI was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on SCI, SSCI and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.},

  abstract = {\$k\$ Nearest Neighbors (\$k\$NN) is one of the most widely used supervised learning algorithms to classify Gaussian distributed data, but it does not achieve good results when it is applied to nonlinear manifold distributed data, especially when a very limited amount of labeled samples are available. In this paper, we propose a new graph-based \$k\$NN algorithm which can effectively handle both Gaussian distributed data and nonlinear manifold distributed data. To achieve this goal, we first propose a constrained Tired Random Walk (TRW) by constructing an \$R\$-level nearest-neighbor strengthened tree over the graph, and then compute a TRW matrix for similarity measurement purposes. After this, the nearest neighbors are identified according to the TRW matrix and the class label of a query point is determined by the sum of all the TRW weights of its nearest neighbors. To deal with online situations, we also propose a new algorithm to handle sequential samples based a local neighborhood reconstruction. Comparison experiments are conducted on both synthetic data sets and real-world data sets to demonstrate the validity of the proposed new \$k\$NN algorithm and its improvements to other version of \$k\$NN algorithms. Given the widespread appearance of manifold structures in real-world problems and the popularity of the traditional \$k\$NN algorithm, the proposed manifold version \$k\$NN shows promising potential for classifying manifold-distributed data.},
